## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AkshatP07/Book-My-Stay.git
    cd Book-My-Stay
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

    npm run dev
    ```

    Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to see the result.

4. **Start Editing Pages:**

    You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

5. **API Routes:**

    API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:4000/[endpoint]. This endpoint can be edited in `api/index.js`.

    Files in this api are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
